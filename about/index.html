        Foster Books has a beautiful bright green exterior that you can't miss
        as you walk down Chiswick High Street. You can see from a quick peek in
        through the window that the store is full to the brim with old books.
        When the weather's good these books will spill out onto the street as
        they set up numerous tables outside the store. Foster Books mostly
        stocks old and rare books so this is a good place to browse if you're
        looking to pick up a first edition of your favourite title.
