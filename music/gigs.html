      <h2>Preservation Hall Jazz Band</h2>
      <h1>Pass It On: 60th Anniversary Musical Celebration</h1>
      <p>
        Preservation Hall is a humble, much-loved room dedicated to keeping the
        past and future of jazz alive. It’s a well-worn, well-loved space that’s
        physically small but spiritually huge. People from around the globe make
        pilgrimages to it, and this fall, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band is
        embarking on a pilgrimage of its own: a nationwide tour to celebrate the
        Hall’s 60th anniversary. The band’s mission remains focused on
        initiating audiences into the ineffable, almost religious experience of
        channeling their ancestors through the music and culture they’ve
        inherited from them.
